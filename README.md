<h1>C# and .NET projects</h1>

This repository has projects I've done at my time at The Tech Academy that demostrates my knowledge in C# and working with the .NET Framework. There are many smaller projects that are technical drills such as math logic, loop through list and arrays, and try/catch statements


<h2>Car Insureance MVC</h2>
<p>I created a .NET Web Application that will calculate a car insurance quote. The quote takes into account your age, driving history, and type of car and year of car and is saved on a database.</p>

<h2>Newsletter App MCV</h2>
<p>The Newsletter App is another MVC Web Application made on the .NET Framework. It allows users to enter their email address to sign up for a newsletter and to unsubscribe to the newsletter. Information entered is saved on a database.</p>

<h2>Code-First</h2>
<p>In the Code-First project, I created a database using code to create table and columns using the .NET Framework</p>

<h2>sixPartAssignment</h2>
<p>In this project I did 6 drills that looped through lists and arrays, used comparison logic with "if else" statements, and created new lists of items from an existing list.</p>
